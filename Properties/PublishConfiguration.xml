## Magic Mail

- Control post offices, post-vans, sorting facilities, and post-trucks.
- Also provides some auto 'magic' fixes for the mail system.


### How to Use

- **Quick Start Button** - 1-Click, set it and forget it (applies recommended defaults).
    - not sure what to do? Just use this button, done, now you can play with a better working mail system.

### Power Users

- Adjust post-van mail load, fleet size, and post-truck fleet size.
- Boost speed and storage capacity for sorting facilities.
- Simple city-wide mail statistics and recent activity in the Status tab.
- All sliders and toggles are optional and can be reset to game defaults (vanilla).

### Fixes for mail issues

1. **auto Fix** low amount of local mail by magically topping up mail when storage drops below a certain amount (you can choose).
2. **auto Fix** mail overflow by trimming overfilled mail buffers at post offices and sorting facilities so they do not remain blocked forever.
3. **auto Fix** low amount of unsorted mail at sorting facilities to keep the sorting active. 
    If you have cargo shipyard, it could be shipping out most of the unsorted mail leaving very little see reference below.
4. Fixes are workaround solution until CO fixes the mail transfer process.

### 5 Languages

- Français French, Deutsch German, Español Spanish,
- English, 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese)


### Compatibility
- Safe to remove at any time; postal facilities will fall back to the
  game's default.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection, less likely to break with game updates.

### Support and Feedback
- If the mod helps you, give it a Like :)
- Report issues on Github link, Forum link, or Discord
